The TEDLIUM VM is a complete training experiment using training data and transcripts from TED talks released in the [TEDLIUM_release1](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/en/content/ted-lium-corpus) data set. This is an advanced VM that requires a LOT of resources, resulting in pretty good (but still quite large) acoustic and language models. There is additional support (by way of an add-on experiment download) for neural net based decoding, including DNN models and PDNN tools.
