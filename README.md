The TEDLIUM VM is a complete training experiment using training data and transcripts from TED talks released in the [TEDLIUM_release1](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/en/content/ted-lium-corpus) data set. This is an advanced VM that requires a LOT of resources, resulting in pretty good (but still quite large) acoustic and language models. There is additional support (by way of add-on experiment downloads) for:
* Decoding with DNN models
* PDNN tools
* Decoding with DNN and filterbank features
* Adapting Your Own Language Model
